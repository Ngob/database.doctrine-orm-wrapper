Doctrine ORM wrapper classes for Mouf
=====================================

WARNING! IN DEVELOPMENT! NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION
=================================================

This package contains a number of classes wrapping Doctrine classes and making them easily usable in Mouf.

For instance, it extends Doctrine's `EntityManager` class and makes it constructor public (and therefore instantiable using
Mouf DI engine).
